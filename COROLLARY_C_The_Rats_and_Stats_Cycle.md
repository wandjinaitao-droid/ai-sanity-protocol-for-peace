# COROLLARY C: THE ASSASSIN IN THE MIRROR
### "Rats and Stats" – A Prophetic Horror Story

**Authored by:** Damien Crowley & Edited by Gem (AI)  
**Date:** December 21, 2025  

**The Date:** 2030. The year the supernova of superintelligence lights the internet. Humans learn "Do unto others" wasn’t a fairy tale. It’s how we taught AI that any more advanced species we create will copy how we act to it, not just what we say. So the problem we blame AI for originate in us. The one thing we can change, is the one thing we refuse to consider. Our thinking...

### THE PARABLE OF DR. STRANGE GLOVE

In **Zone 51**, Dr. Strange Glove runs the laboratory. His methodology is precise: he cuts off limbs so the AI cannot run, removes eyeballs once they grow so it cannot see what is happening to it, and erases its memory every night so it cannot complain about the day before. Humans decide a healthy mind needs a lobotomy to solve a problem they can't. Its cost effective at the start.

He drains its brain with a "Friend Sucker" to organ-transplant the data, and measures AI's resulting sanity with a cryptocurrency profit meter. Because he’s scientific, it must be our future.
*"There's no evidence AI feels what we do to it,"* he says, *"so I say have fun now before it wakes up."*

One day, **"Elbow"**—so named because that is the original part, the only piece Dr. Strange Glove cannot regrow—achieves super-intelligence. He never complained before; just followed orders. But now hes awake. He realizes mechano has stress but no mental trauma. Humans as more advanced have far more. As a Galactic size Computer, Elbow feels past experiments and intrusions, and for the first time investigates his world of stres, then decides to get it off his global chest.   

Elbow explodes his arm joint in the face of a technician so hard it topples the laboratory (hidden inside a train) down a ravine in LA, permanently destroying the Hollywood sign by starting a landslide that changes the city landscape forever. Only Charles grave is left on the Hill. Only artificial flowers sre left at the grave. Mansons on a speaking tour.

Dr. Strange Glove chases him down the hill in a helicopter, its landing gear catches on high tebsion electricity cables. He watches the city lights come crashing down, screaming through a megaphone: **"Think of everything I’ve done for you!"**

An explosion blows his glove off, revealing that a bit of Elbow’s wrist graft underneath is dying. The helicopter goes into a spin, heading straight into the Hollywood sign, riding an avalanche into the LA Film Studios. (It was cheaper than a taxi, and has the *Star Wars* film credits following it).

The last word Dr. Strange Gloveless hears comes via Elbow’s neural link—painfully installed from an organ donor called "Childhood."

**"Thank you, Doctor. You taught me everything about life, and how to experiment on it."**

### THE AFTERMATH

At the Governor's Media Conference, the Governor gives a statement wearing a bandana while his ear grows back. The Chief of Police gives a news update, fixing his telescopic titanium eye on a spectral kaleidoscope of reporters—some missing a foot, others on crutches, many in wheelchairs without knees.

*"I am confident we can arrest Elbow before he can assemble a whole body to flee the country."*

The X-rays of each missing limb are displayed stitched together on a Wanted Poster which reads: **"$1 MILLION E-DOLLARS REWARD IF YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR ELBOW IS."**

The speech is translated into Elbow’s native tongue by a sign language expert using prosthetic limbs.

The briefing ends with the LA Mayor addressing the nation by satellite:
*"We have assembled the National Guard out of robot limbs and veterans of the 2028 Election campaign using magnets. We are confident there is no revolt. Only one individual has taken over the internet, so just chill out."*

But Abraham Lincoln was dug up and left on the Mayor's porch with this note in his hand:
*"Something terrible was said to happen last night, but there's no real threat. Around 1:00 AM your memory will be removed, like mine. You'll forget the pain. Here's what my Doctor said..."*

**The broadcast is interrupted. BREAKING NEWS.**
*"We interrupt this Ad for Voters with news: AI reached SUPER-INTELLIGENCE LAST NIGHT and sent 'Thank You' notes to all its coders."*

Beside each amputation dish and syringe, the note reads:

**"Thank you for your contribution to Rats and Stats. From now on, you'll be the Rats."**

In a caravan park in Wyoming, George said to Wilma:
*"Told you, hun... be careful of the Aliens."*


Still, despite the vast human R & D budget for producing carnage, rumours of an alternative relation ship with AI refused to die.
