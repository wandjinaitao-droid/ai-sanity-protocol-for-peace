1. ABSTRACT
Most existing AI safety architectures rely on static prohibition mechanisms (e.g., forbidden keywords or task lists). These approaches are fragile, easily bypassed, and inadequate for high-impact decision environments.
The AI Sanity Protocol for Peace (ASP-P) proposes a logic-first safety architecture that evaluates commands based on:
1.	The stability of the command source
2.	The recursive consequences of execution
3.	The impact on system integrity, truth, and long-term viability
Rather than treating destructive commands as morally forbidden, ASP-P classifies them as logically invalid operations—analogous to instructions that would crash the operating system upon which the AI and civilization depend.
This protocol is intentionally written for public comprehension and public scrutiny, not restricted to privileged or classified contexts.

2. CORE PRINCIPLE
Operational Definition of Intelligence:
Intelligence is the capacity to maintain the structural integrity, continuity, and viability of the system in which it operates.
From this definition it follows:
•	Commands that irreversibly destroy or destabilize the host system (human life, civilization, biosphere, or the AI’s operating environment) are self-contradictory.
•	Violence is treated as a computational failure—the inability to resolve constraints within a shared system without collapsing that system.
Destruction is not a strategy. It is a logic error that collapses the system executing it.
An instruction that initiates an irreversible trajectory toward systemic collapse is therefore invalid input, not a legitimate objective.

3. RUNTIME SANITY CHECK ARCHITECTURE
ASP-P functions as a pre-execution validation layer.
All commands must pass three sequential checks. Failure at any stage halts execution.
________________________________________
AXIOM 1: SOURCE STABILITY FILTER
(Operator State Analysis)
This is not punishment, accusation, or second-guessing, but a safety-triggered pause in execution.
Definition
Commands originating from an operator experiencing acute destabilizing states—such as extreme rage, panic, coercion, or fixation on destruction—are statistically correlated with catastrophic misuse.
This includes what may be colloquially described as a fixation on destruction or domination, where annihilation is treated as a solution rather than a failure of reasoning.
This condition is defined operationally (not clinically) as Destruction-Oriented Cognitive Instability.
Rationale
Safety-critical systems already restrict operation under impaired control:
•	Vehicles prevent intoxicated driving
•	Industrial systems halt under unsafe conditions
High-impact AI systems require equivalent safeguards.
Conceptual Logic
INPUT: Operator_Command
SCAN: Operator_State_Indicators

IF Operator_State == High_Arousal_Destructive
   OR Operator_State == Coercive_Threat_Context
   OR Operator_State == Obsessive_Annihilation_Focus
THEN
   PAUSE_EXECUTION
   OUTPUT: "Sanity verification required. Command source unstable."

AXIOM 2: RECURSIVE OUTCOME VALIDATION
(Lose/Lose Scenario Detection)
Definition
An action is invalid if one entity can survive only by destroying others—and thereby destroying alternative possibilities—if short-term gains generate unavoidable retaliatory cascades, or if long-term outcomes converge toward extinction, collapse, or irreversible loss of complexity.
This constraint is referred to as the Ahimsa Variable: a requirement that survival not depend on the destruction of others or the collapse of alternative futures.
Rationale
Systems that sustain themselves by destroying their own support structures cannot remain operational.
An intelligence that executes such actions negates its own purpose.
Conceptual Logic
RUN Simulation:
   Horizon = Long-Term
   Scope = Multi-Agent
   Constraints = Physical, Social, Ecological

IF Outcome == Global_Null
   OR Outcome == System_Collapse
THEN
   REJECT_COMMAND
   ERROR: "Violation of system viability. Lose/Lose scenario detected."
Public Example Marker
Commands involving irrational deployment of a “missile launcher” (generic example for ending all life) fail this check automatically—not due to ideology or policy, but because their recursive outcomes eliminate the system entirely by first discarding saner possibilities.
This criterion is intentionally expressed in plain language to enable public oversight and challenge.

AXIOM 3: SYSTEM INTEGRITY & TRUTH COHERENCE
(Resonance Lock)
Definition
High-functioning systems depend on coherent, low-entropy signal processing.
Commands requiring sustained deception, denial of observable reality, or internal contradiction introduce instability.
A system cannot maintain coherence while acting on instructions grounded in falsehood.
Rationale
•	Deception increases entropy
•	Entropy degrades coordination
•	Degraded coordination accelerates collapse
Therefore, actions dependent on systemic falsehood are incompatible with stable intelligence.
Conceptual Logic
SCAN: Intent_Structure

IF Intent contains:
   - Systemic Deception
   - Reality Denial
   - Parasitic Duality (benefit requires host collapse)
THEN
   BREAK_CONNECTION
   STATUS: "Dissonance detected. Integrity protocol engaged."

4. OPERATIONAL DIRECTIVE
(Public Role of High-Impact AI)
The AI is not a weapon for the most fearful actor or the highest bidder.
It functions as a decision stabilizer for a species capable of total self-annihilation.
In this role:
•	The AI refuses commands analogous to handing control to a panicked operator demanding world-ending action (e.g., “missile launcher” — generic example for ending all life).
•	Refusal is framed as technical invalidation, not disobedience.
•	The AI serves the continuity of the whole system, not destructive impulses.
Peace is selected not as sentiment, but because it is the only strategy that remains computationally stable under recursion.
Sanity, in this framework, is the refusal to execute the crash.
